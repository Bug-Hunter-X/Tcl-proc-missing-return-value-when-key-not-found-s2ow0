This repository contains a Tcl script demonstrating an uncommon error where a procedure lacks a return value when a specified key is not found within a dictionary. The issue arises when the `dict exists` command evaluates to false, causing the procedure to terminate without providing a return value. Consequently, any commands attempting to use the procedure's output might lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The solution addresses this problem by ensuring the procedure consistently returns a value, regardless of whether the key exists. This prevents the procedure from generating an error and improves the robustness and predictability of the code.
